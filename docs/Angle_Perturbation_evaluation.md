Similar to Domain Shift evaluation, There are two steps to Angle Perturbation evaluation.

1. Dataset -> csv
   The angle perturbations chosen are \[1,2.5,5,7.5,10\]. The perturbed X-ray LAT view is assumed to be available at
   `Dataset>BIDS>subject-id>derivatives>xray_from_ct_angle_perturbation>`.
